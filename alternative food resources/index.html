            <p>As many of us don't know what is meant by altering food resources. Altering food resources means changing
                the way that food that we are eating now
                because in future there is no food what we are eating now. In future the food will change according to
                the availability of resources on the earth.
                But we can change the habitat of food by changing by human practices and in other ways.This can include
                changes in agricultural practices, such as the use of genetically modified crops or organic farming
                methods,
                as well as changes in food processing and packaging, such as the use of preservatives or alternative
                packaging materials.

        <div class="other-content">
            <p>Plant-based proteins, such as tofu, tempeh, and legumes, are being promoted as alternatives to
                animal-based proteins. Plant-based proteins require fewer resources to produce than traditional
                livestock and are often more environmentally sustainable. Additionally, plant-based proteins are often
                less expensive and provide a variety of health benefits. However, it is important to note that some
                plant-based proteins may not provide all the essential nutrients that animal-based proteins do.</p>

            <p>Insects are being explored as a potential source of protein, as they require fewer resources to produce
                than traditional livestock and have a lower environmental impact. Additionally, insects are a common
                food source in many cultures and are considered a delicacy in some countries. However, there are
                significant cultural barriers to the widespread adoption of insect-based protein in Western countries,
                and there are concerns around the safety and ethics of insect farming.</p>

        <div class="other-content">
            <p>Cell-based meats, also known as lab-grown meats, are produced by culturing animal cells in a lab rather
                than raising and slaughtering animals. This technology has the potential to reduce the environmental
                impact of meat production and improve animal welfare. Additionally, cell-based meats have the potential
                to provide a sustainable source of meat for those who want to reduce their meat consumption. However,
                there are concerns around the safety and scalability of this technology, and it remains unclear how
                consumers will respond to this new product.</p>

        <div class="other-content">
            <p>Vertical farming involves growing crops in stacked layers using artificial lighting and a controlled
                environment. This method of farming can increase food production in urban areas and reduce the
                environmental impact of traditional agriculture. Additionally, vertical farming can reduce the
                transportation costs associated with traditional agriculture and provide a year-round source of fresh
                produce. However, vertical farming requires significant energy inputs, and the high capital costs
                associated with this method of farming may limit its scalability.</p>

            <p>Reducing food waste is also considered an alternative food resource, as it can help to address food
                insecurity and reduce the environmental impact of food production. Food waste reduction can be achieved
                through a variety of means, such as improving supply chain efficiencies

            <p>Altering food resources involves making changes to the way food is grown, processed, distributed, and
                consumed. These changes can help ensure that everyone has access to enough food and that food resources
                are used efficiently and sustainably. Governments, NGOs, and the private sector can work together to
                promote and implement these changes to ensure food security for all.

    <h2>Impacts of altering food resources:-</h2>
    <p>Altering food resources can have both positive and negative impacts on nature and human beings. 
        While some changes can help improve food security, reduce waste, and promote sustainability, 
        other changes may have unintended consequences that can harm the environment and human health.There are mainly three major impacts on humans 
        because of altering food resource</br>
        1.Environmental risks</br>
        2.Health risks</br>
        3.Social risks</br>
